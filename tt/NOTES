TO DO:
-- Manage Timetables (delete, modify size)
-- add validations (yuck, long and clerical task)
-- urlencode GET stuff
-- reset/revert for the resource availability editor
-- clean up code
-- OPTIMIZATION: when generating/creating/editing activities, set the ids of
the resources as values for the options in selects, to avoid makeing that many
queries when editing resources
-- add class groups (groups that contain classes)
-- add different length activities (right now all activities last 1 interval)
-- check rooms by size when allocating
-- modify the size for many resources at once
-- modify the type and length for many activities at once
-- more helpful error reporting (which activitiy/ies caused problems, and what
could be done about it - in case of an error the old timetable is kept, if any)
-- when tweaking a timetable, show the other affected timetable (if tweaking a
prof's timetable show the class timetable for the class involved in the tweaked
activity and the other way around)
